Requirements:                                                                                                                  

1) In the native Android 3.0, Google switched from having a dedicated menu key to using the ActionBar for menu functionality.                                                                         
2) If your build target is 3.0 or above, your menu will default to using the ActionBar.                                        
3) The kony Studio also behaves like the same.                                                                                                                                                 
4) If you are using target SDK version is above 3.0 then you have to make sure that you are selecting the Action Bar 
   property in the preoprties--> native--> android.
